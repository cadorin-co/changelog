# CHANGELOG/AUTO TAGGING

This repo was created to test changelog and tag generation.

## Auto Tagger

The auto tagger uses the merge commit message to create the tags, so be sure to add either `#major`, `#minor` or `#patch` on it, if it's anot added `#patch` will be assumed.

## CHANGELOG

Changelog will be generated and commited in the main branch when the PR status is closed.
